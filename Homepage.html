        Hello! Welcome to Get Political, we are so glad you have decided to join us on educating the world on the recent social troubles we are facing.
        This app was created to help educate and inform people who tend to shy away from these issues, so that we all as a community can have more open coversations about awkward topics.
        Our app will let you choose a topic each day that you can read about and see all the latest news and headlines that interest you. We also have a donation page where you
        can donate to organisations that need it the most!

        Get Political is a vital part of throwing away the stigma around conversations about the environmental and social issues we face everyday in the world. 
        If we start educating today, we can hold the dsicussion tommorrow and each day after, the smallest of changes can make the largest differences in spreading awareness of these important topics.
        We want to help you and everyone around you learn new things and grow their knowledge.
